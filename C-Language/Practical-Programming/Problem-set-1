a) Curly Braces denote a block of code where we can define variables that will last up to the end of that block.
We use it in a function because we need to delimit the scope(extend of the block) of each function.
Oficial answer: "The curly braces denote a block of code, in which variables can be declared. Variables declared within the block are valid only until the end of the block, marked by the matching right curly brace ’}’. The body of a function is one such type of block, and thus, curly braces are used to describe the extent of that block."

b) Literal 7: is a constant numeric; "7" is a character representing the number 7 and '7' is basically the same.
Oficial answer: "The first literal describes an integer of value 7.
The second describes a null- terminated string consisting of the character ’7’.
The third describes the character ’7’, whose value is its ASCII character code (55). 

c) double ans = 10.0 + (2.0 / (3.0 − 2.0) ∗ 2.0); ans = 11;
Oficial answer: 10.0 + 2.0 / (3.0 - 2.0) * 2.0);
